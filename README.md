# Loan-Status-Prediction
# Summary:
* Predicted loan status with an accuracy of 82% using Random Forest classifier, Na√Øve Bayes, KNN, Logistic Regression, XGBoost classifier models, with XGBoost classifier having highest accuracy
* Implemented Stack ensemble of the above models to achieve higher accuracy of 84% and f1 score of 0.8466, which performed better using single models for prediction
* Implemented pre-processing methods such as handling missing values, data deduplication, class balancing methods such as SMOTE, EDA, outlier removal to improve efficiency by 20%
# Uses:
* Training model to predict loan status on the past data with high accuracy provides us useful model to identify customer who has high chance of defaulting payment in future.
